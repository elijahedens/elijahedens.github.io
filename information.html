       <p style="font-family: optima; text-align: center; font-size: 20px">Although manual transmissions may seem like extra work, there are numerous advantages of learning how to drive a stick shift.  Many manual transmission drivers prefer a manual transmission because it gives the driver a feeling of being in control of the vehicle. In an automatic transmission vehicle, the torque converter pushes the vehicle forward. Manual transmission vehicles do not have a torque converter. For this reason, manual transmission drivers are able to use the momentum of the engine to slow the vehicle down and brake more easily. Furthermore, manual transmissions also offer improved gas mileage. Depending on road conditions and driving habits, a manual transmission vehicle can consume 5-15% less fuel than a similar automatic transmission vehicle. If the driver operates the vehicle efficiently, the driver will save money on fuel over time. </p>
