     <h2 style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 28px"> Where are all the manual vehicles?</h2>
     <p style="font-family: optima; text-align: center; font-size: 20px">In the US, manual transmission is much lower in demand, therefore manufacturers don't produce as many models. Low demand means lower retail price and less profit, and the car itself is going to be much more difficult to get rid of. As a result, automakers struggle to make any money on manual vehicles, and so manufacturing costs don't amount to the return they would recieve, hints why it's becoming so difficult to find a manual transmission vehicle. Bottom line is you should get one while they last!</p>
