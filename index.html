    <p style="font-family: optima; text-align: center; font-size: 20px"> With a manual transmission, you decide when to shift the gears. No computer that thinks it knows better than you about driving and shifting. No wondering when the transmission will upshift, or the opposite situation when the transmission upshifts itself even though you have put it into “manual” mode. If you want to drive the engine higher into the RPM range than normal, feel free to do so with a manual gearbox. You’ll never be in a situation where your manual transmission shifts itself at an opportune time. Furthermore, since manual transmissions are less common and learning to drive one is not required in driver’s education, a surprisingly low number of Americans know how to drive them. That includes a thief looking for an easy target.</p>

    <h2 style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 28px"> So here's how to drive them...</h2>
    <br>
    <ol style="font-style: optima; font-size: 20px;">
      <li>Ensure you're in neutral (you are able to wiggle the shifter left to right if you are)</li>
      <li>Place your foot on the clutch pedal (pedal on the very left)</li>
      <li>Place key in the ignition and turn the vehicle on</li>
      <li>If the parking brake is engaged, release it (the vehicle can now roll, so be careful)</li>
      <li>Now you can place the shifter into the first gear position, while maintaining your foot depressed on the clutch</li>
      <li>Move forward: Slowly release the clutch and as you release psh slightly on the accelerator pedal, once the clutch is fully disengaged you can proceed driving in first gear normally</li>
      <li>As you continue to drive, you should shift gears around 2,500 RPM to 4,000 RPM</li>
      <li>To shift gears you must always release the accelerator entirely, and depress the clutch- then you may change gears and begin to release the clutch as you continue to accelerate</li>
      <li>Give yourself a pat on the back, you did it</li>
      </ol>
